This project involves building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The dataset used contains 5,574 messages with corresponding labels, and the project implements a Bag-of-Words approach to convert the messages into numerical features. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained to predict whether a given message is spam or ham, with the model achieving high accuracy.

Inference: The ANN model shows excellent performance, with training and testing accuracies exceeding 98%. The model effectively distinguishes between spam and ham messages, showing strong precision and recall values. Despite minor loss fluctuations during training, the modelâ€™s accuracy remains stable across epochs, suggesting robust learning.

Conclusion: This project demonstrates the effective use of ANN for text classification tasks, specifically for spam detection in SMS messages. With an accuracy of 98.3% on the test set, the model is reliable for practical applications in filtering spam messages, contributing to improved user experience in communication systems.
